A primary key is used to identify uniquely each record in a table.

Foreign Keys are used to enforce database integrity. In layman's terms, a foreign key in one table points to a primary key in another table.
The foreign key constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column. The values that you enter into the foreign
key column, has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to.

A column default can be specified using Default constraint. The DEFAULT constraint is used to insert a default value into a column.
The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified, including NULL.

Cascading referential integrity constraint allows to define the actions Microsoft SQL Server should take when a user attempts to delete or update
a key to which an existing foreign keys points.
Options when setting up Cascading referential integrity constraint:
1. No Action: This is the default behavior. No Action specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by 
foreign keys in existing rows in other tables, an error is raised and the DELETE or UPDATE is rolled back.

2. Cascade: Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in exiting rows in other tables,
all rows containing those foreign keys are also deleted or updated.

3. Set NULL: Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables,
all rows containing those foreign keys are set to NULL.

4. Set Default: Specifies that if an attempt is made to delete or update a row with a key referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables,
all rows containing those foreign keys are set to default values.

Check Constraint:
CHECK constraint is used to limit the range of values, that can be entered for a column.
A constraint is just a boolean expression which returns a True or a False.
